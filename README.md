## 🚀 Project Overview  

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end Clinical Trial Management System**, built to monitor and visualize **patient recruitment, adherence, and operational metrics** across multiple sites.  
It’s a full-stack data analytics case study integrating **PostgreSQL**, **FastAPI**, and **React.js**, hosted seamlessly via **Railway** and **Netlify**.  

The system empowers trial managers and data teams to:
- Track **patient enrollment, visit adherence, and eDiary submission** in real time.  
- Evaluate **site performance** and detect operational bottlenecks.  
- Provide **transparent clinical insights** through interactive dashboards.
